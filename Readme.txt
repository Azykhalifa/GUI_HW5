Write up:
In this assignment I have implemented the validation for dictionary. In oder to do that, I have downloaded a Validation dictionary from GitHub link mentioned below.
Dictionary is downloaded from "https://github.com/dwyl/english-words"

I had to download some of the scrabble images from online such as the background behind the letters on the board. 
Later also realized, professor gave us some of that in graphics data folder. Most of the files were used from that.

According to the grading rubric given in the pdf, I would save most of the requirements have been satisfied in my assignment.

I have used the Scrabble Words stored in Array data structures for my assignment. I took took references  from Prof. Heines array given to us on the pdf.

I implemented the drag and drop feature in my index.js file for the main functionality of the game. 

Overall, this was a good assignment as we got to build up on our knowledge of jquery UI and we also learned to work with data structures. I also thought it was difficult because lot of the concepts were new to me. However, they were fun to learn and implement.
